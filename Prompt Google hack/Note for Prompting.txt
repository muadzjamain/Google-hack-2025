Great question! Here’s a breakdown to help you decide whether to include the Use Case Diagram image in Windsurf or not:

✅ When It’s OK to Show the Image
You want Windsurf to understand the structure of your system precisely.
Your goal is to maintain consistency across documentation (e.g., between prompt and visual).
You are asking Windsurf to generate something based on this exact use case layout, like test cases, sequence diagrams, or UI layout.
⚠️ When the Image Might Limit Windsurf
If your prompt contains richer information than the diagram (like your earlier full-text project scope), Windsurf might rely too heavily on the image and miss your intent.
The image may lock Windsurf into the exact structure, limiting creative or optimized suggestions (especially if you want enhancement).
Windsurf may summarize or only interpret what’s in the image, ignoring your broader vision or future features not drawn yet.
🧠 Recommended Approach
✔ Option 1: Prompt first, then upload image (if needed)

Start with your detailed project description/prompt (like the one you’ve crafted).
Then say something like:
"Here’s my current use case diagram. Please ensure it aligns, but feel free to suggest improvements beyond it."
✔ Option 2: Use image only for visualization reference

Mention: “This is for reference only, not for limiting creativity.”
That way Windsurf will see it as a guide, not a constraint.
✅ Final Verdict
Yes, you can show it — but add a short clarification in your prompt like:

“Attached is the use case diagram for EduZen as reference. Please prioritize the prompt below and treat the image as a structural aid, not a constraint.”
