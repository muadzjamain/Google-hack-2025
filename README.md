üìå Revised Project Scope: AI Study Buddy & Well-Being Assistant (EduZen)
EduZen is a lightweight AI-powered assistant designed to support students both academically and emotionally. Instead of building a complex learning management system, EduZen focuses on delivering core, meaningful features using Google AI technologies. The system offers two major components: an AI-Powered Study Companion and an AI-Powered Well-Being Assistant that work hand-in-hand to improve learning efficiency while reducing academic stress.

üåü AI-Powered Study Companion
The AI Study Companion allows students to upload images of lecture notes or textbooks. The system uses Google Cloud Vision API to extract text, which is then summarized into key points using Google Gemini API or Firebase ML Kit. The assistant automatically generates multiple-choice quizzes and flashcards based on the content, helping students revise quickly and interactively.
The interface is built for simplicity, allowing students to easily interact with their generated study content. Users can also revisit their past learning materials through a progress tracker and optionally export the generated summaries and quizzes to Google Docs, Google Drive, or deploy quizzes through Google Forms.

üßò AI-Powered Well-Being Assistant (Built into the AI Tutor)
EduZen‚Äôs AI Tutor is more than just a study tool ‚Äî it also acts as a mental health companion. Through Google Dialogflow, students can chat with the AI to seek guidance or simply express how they‚Äôre feeling. The assistant uses Firebase ML Kit to perform sentiment analysis and detect stress levels in user messages. If signs of stress are detected, the assistant will respond with supportive messages, motivational quotes, guided breathing exercises, or suggest taking short breaks.
This functionality ensures that EduZen doesn‚Äôt just push productivity ‚Äî it promotes a healthy, balanced study experience. Additionally, the system can schedule reminders for study or rest using Google Calendar, helping students maintain a productive rhythm without burning out.
